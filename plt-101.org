The idea would be to follow along Programming Languages Foundations
[[https://plfa.github.io][which is an executable book in literate Agda]]

Wadler, Philip, Wen Kokke, and Jeremy G. Siek. Programming Language
Foundations in Agda. Available at https://plfa.inf.ed.ac.uk/22.08/. 2022.

My progress on this has been feeble but I learned to love using Agda -
there's something very satisfying about doing these basic proofs. [[https://github.com/sebeaumont/myplta][My
