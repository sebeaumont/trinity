#+TITLE: Computational Trinitarianism
#+AUTHOR: Simon Beaumont

Started (and ended) in 2013, a collection of mainly literate org files
(that can be tangled to some /Haskell/ if required), containing a
smattering of type and category theory picked up and presented whilst
investigating the state of the art in /Haskell/ effects.

This ended up as a run through the main tenets of computational
trinitarianism and getting back to basics with /Agda/.

Provided here for interest and posterity only.

- [[./summary.org][Summary of my understanding of key ideas]]
  
- [[chart.org][Guide to contents]] (could form basis a FP course)

- [[haskell-effects.org][Reviewed material on effects]] (the initial motivation but not that
  relevant now)
